# Phase B.6A — Analyzer→Persistence Bridge (Mirror Phase)

**Status:** planning locked, implementation pending
**Sub-phase of:** B.6 (Analyzer → canonical persistence convergence)
**Predecessor:** B.5 (lead score snapshot primitives) at `3152f4a`
**Successor:** B.6B (legacy retirement; analyze() becomes thin wrapper)
**Doctrine refs:** `feedback_design_for_scale_implement_for_simplicity.md`,
`feedback_inspectability_over_abstraction.md`, `feedback_phase_gating.md`,
`feedback_logical_modularity_first.md`

---

## §1 Purpose

B.6A produces the bridge between the legacy in-memory analyzer
(`app/domain/scoring.py:analyze`) and the canonical persistence stack
(`compute_lead_score` + `record_lead_score` + the lead_* tables) under
strict mirror discipline:

  - The legacy analyzer's response contract is **untouched**.
  - The HTTP endpoint that calls it is **untouched**.
  - Every dark code path the bridge introduces is provably-correct
    under synthetic and replay validation BEFORE any production write
    path is wired.
  - Convergence (retiring `_blended_score`, making `analyze` a thin
    wrapper) happens in B.6B, **gated by B.6A's evidence**.

**Primary outcome is NOT "the bridge exists." It is: "we can
confidently explain WHY the legacy and canonical scores agree or
disagree, with row-by-row signal- and weight-provenance attribution."**

If B.6A delivers a working bridge but no explainability surface,
B.6B is blocked. The divergence tooling is co-equal scope with the
orchestrator, not afterthought.

## §2 Decisions locked (Andrew, 2026-05-11)

1. **Account context for demo Lead:** hard-coded demo account.
   - Keeps tenancy/auth concerns isolated; reversibility high.
   - Avoids premature account-resolution semantics.
   - Bridge writes go to a single deterministic account row;
     real-account semantics deferred to a later phase.

2. **Vertical resolution:** use the existing `vertical.pack_id`
   column (NOT NULL + UNIQUE).
   - **Audit correction (2026-05-11):** `vertical.pack_id` already
     exists with stricter constraints than the original plan
     proposed — added in migration 0007 (B.3.3) as `NOT NULL` with
     a full `UniqueConstraint` (see `backend/app/db/models/vertical.py:43-46`
     and `backend/alembic/versions/0007_vertical.py:38,53`). **No
     schema migration needed for B.6A.**
   - Canonical stack resolves `vertical_id` from `pack_id` via the
     existing column. The demo vertical row is seeded in
     migration 0020 with
     `pack_id = settings.default_vertical_pack_id`
     (currently `"local_business_ai_visibility"`).
   - Explicit resolver; no "magic by name" conventions. Do NOT
     generalize beyond what B.6A needs (no pack registry refactor,
     no vertical lifecycle change).

3. **Lead identity per call:** lead-per-call.
   - Dedupe semantics were intentionally deferred in B.4
     (`project_b4_scope_lead_primitives.md`).
   - Each bridge call writes a fresh Lead row; demo rows
     intentionally accumulate (this is a validation substrate, not
     production semantics).
   - Replay/test isolation is cleaner with per-call identity.

4. **Weight parity seeding strategy:** hard-code weights in migration
   body with explicit provenance comments.
   - Migration is a frozen historical bootstrap artifact.
   - Runtime coupling inside migrations is dangerous; reproducibility
     beats DRY purity here.
   - Comment block in migration body cites the pack source-of-truth
     at seed time.

5. **Endpoint touch in B.6A scope:** strict reading.
   - The analyze endpoint is **not modified** in B.6A.
   - Test corpus is the operational validation layer.
   - Live endpoint wiring (with feature flag, fail-safe persistence)
     is an explicit gate decision for B.6A.5 or B.6B once parity
     confidence + divergence tooling + replay guarantees exist.

---

## §3 Out of scope for B.6A

Explicitly NOT in B.6A:

- Modification of `app/domain/scoring.py`, `app/domain/signals.py`,
  or any HTTP route.
- Modification of the `vertical_signal_weight` table (legacy
  pack-level weights). These remain authoritative for the legacy
  analyzer until B.6B.
- Lead dedupe / upsert by (business_name, city).
- Real-tenancy resolution (auth → account_id).
- UI / frontend changes.
- Vertical pack lifecycle (ADR-048) implementation.
- Read APIs for leads / scores / events.
- Background recompute jobs.
- Property-based testing (deferred; corpus-based tests sufficient).
- Removing or renaming `_blended_score` (retirement is B.6B).
- Population of `LEAD_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS` in the legacy pack at
  `backend/app/vertical/packs/local_business_ai_visibility/lead_signal_weights.py`.
  Per audit decision (2026-05-11), the seed migration is the sole
  B.6A source of truth for canonical lead-scoring weights; the
  pack's dict stays empty. B.6B may converge sources.

## §4 Architecture

### §4.1 New files (all additive)

```
backend/
  alembic/versions/
    0020_seed_demo_account_vertical_catalog.py   # B.6A.1
  app/domain/
    scoring_persistence.py                 # B.6A.2 (adapter)

    test_bridge_corpus.py                  # B.6A.5
```

### §4.2 Signal adapter (B.6A.2)

Pure function. No DB, no I/O.

```python
def signal_results_to_observations(
    results: list[SignalResult],
) -> list[SignalObservation]:
    """Translate legacy SignalResult instances into the value-dict
    shape that record_lead_signal + compute_lead_score consume.

    Each SignalObservation carries:
      - signal_name: str (matches lead_signal_definition.name)
      - value: dict[str, Any] with required top-level 'score' key
        (Decimal in [0.0, 1.0]) per phase-b5-plan.md §2 #4
      - source: str (e.g. "legacy_analyzer:v1") for provenance

    Raises ValueError if any score is outside [0.0, 1.0].
    """
```

`SignalObservation` is a frozen dataclass (not persisted; transport
shape only).

### §4.3 Divergence comparator (B.6A.3)

The explainability layer. Two dataclasses + one helper:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SignalContributionDiff:
    signal_name: str
    legacy_score: Decimal
    canonical_score: Decimal
    legacy_weight: Decimal       # from pack.signal_weights()
    canonical_weight: Decimal    # from vertical_lead_signal_weight
    legacy_contribution: Decimal
    canonical_contribution: Decimal
    contribution_delta: Decimal  # canonical - legacy


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ScoreDivergence:
    legacy_score: int                     # legacy _blended_score output
    canonical_score: Decimal              # ComputedLeadScore.score
    delta: int                            # legacy - int(canonical)
    within_tolerance: bool                # abs(delta) <= TOLERANCE
    signal_breakdown: list[SignalContributionDiff]
    weight_version_at: datetime           # canonical replay timestamp
    vertical_id: UUID
    lead_id: UUID | None                  # None if not persisted
    snapshot_id: UUID | None              # None if not persisted


BRIDGE_DIVERGENCE_TOLERANCE: int = 1


def compute_divergence(
    *,
    legacy_results: list[SignalResult],
    legacy_pack_weights: dict[str, Decimal],
    canonical_computed: ComputedLeadScore,
    canonical_weights: list[VerticalLeadSignalWeight],
    vertical_id: UUID,
    lead_id: UUID | None = None,
    snapshot_id: UUID | None = None,
) -> ScoreDivergence:
    """Row-by-row diff. Joins by signal_name. Missing signals on
    either side appear with Decimal('0') on the absent side."""


def explain_divergence(divergence: ScoreDivergence) -> str:
    """Human-readable rendering. Used in test failures, operator
    logs, and future debug endpoints. Multi-line; signal-by-signal."""


def log_divergence(divergence: ScoreDivergence, logger) -> None:
    """Emit a structured log line per ADR-030.

    event = "bridge.score_comparison"
    level = DEBUG if delta == 0
            INFO  if 0 < |delta| <= TOLERANCE
            ERROR if |delta| > TOLERANCE
    """
```

The dataclasses are JSON-serializable (Decimals → strings) so the
log line is queryable per ADR-030 conventions.

### §4.4 Orchestrator (B.6A.4)

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BridgeResult:
    response: AnalyzeResponse      # legacy contract preserved
    snapshot: LeadScoreSnapshot    # canonical persisted row
    divergence: ScoreDivergence    # always populated


async def analyze_and_persist(
    *,
    business_name: str,
    location: str,
    trade: str | None,
    account_id: UUID,              # demo account in B.6A
    vertical_id: UUID,             # resolved via pack_id lookup
    lead_repo: LeadRepository,
    lead_signal_repo: LeadSignalRepository,
    signal_definition_repo: LeadSignalDefinitionRepository,
    weight_repo: VerticalLeadSignalWeightRepository,
    score_repo: LeadScoreSnapshotRepository,
    now_fn: Callable[[], datetime] = _default_now,
) -> BridgeResult:
    """Mirror-phase orchestrator: legacy + canonical in one call.

    Steps (all inside one async-session transaction):
      1. Run legacy analyze() to get SignalResult[]
      2. Build legacy AnalyzeResponse (existing logic, unchanged)
      3. Create a new Lead row (lead-per-call, no dedupe)
      4. signal_results_to_observations(...) -> SignalObservation[]
      5. record_lead_signal x4 (all-or-nothing)
      6. record_lead_score(...) -> LeadScoreSnapshot
      7. compute_divergence(...) and log_divergence(...)
      8. Return BridgeResult

    All-or-nothing: if any record_lead_signal raises (missing catalog
    row, ValueError on score), the whole transaction aborts. No
    partial writes.
    """
```

No HTTP wiring. Not called from any prod path in B.6A.

## §5 Schema changes

### §5.1 Migration 0020: seed demo account + vertical + catalog

Single migration, single transaction, idempotent (uses
`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the natural keys of each
target table).

`down_revision = "0019_lead_score_snapshot"`.

**Insert order** (FK satisfaction):
1. `account` row
2. `vertical` row
3. 4× `lead_signal_definition` rows
4. 4× `vertical_lead_signal_weight` rows

Seeds:

- **demo account**: deterministic id via UUID5 from a fixed
  namespace + "demo" so the seed is reproducible and re-runs
  collapse to no-ops.
  - `display_name = "demo"`
  - other defaults: `status="active"` (server_default),
    `region="us"` (server_default), `parent_account_id=NULL`

- **demo vertical** linked to the existing `pack_id` column:
  - `pack_id = "local_business_ai_visibility"` (matches
    `settings.default_vertical_pack_id`)
  - `display_name = "Local Business AI Visibility"`
  - `schema_version = 1`
  - deterministic UUID5 id for reproducibility
  - source: `app/vertical/packs/local_business_ai_visibility/__init__.py:47-49`

- **lead_signal_definition** rows for the 4 legacy signals
  (PK = `name`, FK target for the weight rows below). Each with:
  - `source_kind = "computed"`
  - `contributes_to = ["lead_quality"]` (audit-corrected from
    `["business_visibility"]` to match the codebase convention
    in `app/vertical/seed.py:60`)
  - `default_enabled = true` (server_default)
  - `default_weight` = the pack value below (preserves
    numeric(4,3) precision; provenance in migration comment)
  - `freshness_ttl_seconds` = `86400` (24h; matches the existing
    `LeadSignalDefinition` test fixture default)
  - `description` = brief one-line cite of the legacy probe

  The 4 names:
  - `website_presence`
  - `google_business_presence`
  - `content_signals`
  - `reviews`

- **vertical_lead_signal_weight** rows for the demo vertical, ONE
  per signal:
  - `dimension = "lead_quality"` (audit-corrected from `"overall"`
    to match `LEAD_SIGNAL_WEIGHT_DEFAULT_DIMENSION` in
    `app/vertical/seed.py:60`)
  - `weight` = the pack value (numeric(4,3))
  - `effective_from = '2026-05-11 00:00:00+00'`
  - `effective_to = NULL` (active)
  - `enabled = true` (server_default)

**Provenance comment block** (populated with audit-verified values):

```
-- Weights mirror the legacy pack-level WEIGHTS dict at seed time.
-- Source: backend/app/vertical/packs/local_business_ai_visibility/weights.py
-- (B.6A authored 2026-05-11; pack_id = "local_business_ai_visibility").
--
-- NOTE: LEAD_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS in the pack is intentionally empty
-- (B.4.6 deferred). The migration is the SOLE B.6A source of truth
-- for canonical lead-scoring weights. Per phase-b6a-plan.md §2
-- decision #4 + §3 out-of-scope.
--
-- DO NOT auto-sync at runtime — treat this migration as a frozen
-- historical bootstrap artifact. If pack weights change before
-- B.6B convergence, re-run this seed OR document the divergence.
--
-- Source values at seed time (sum = 1.000):
--   website_presence:           0.300
--   google_business_presence:   0.300
--   content_signals:            0.200
--   reviews:                    0.200
```

### §5.2 What does NOT change

- `vertical.pack_id` column itself — already exists per B.3.3.
  No schema migration in B.6A.
- `vertical_signal_weight` (B.3.3) — legacy pack weights,
  untouched. Authoritative for `analyze()` until B.6B.
- `app/vertical/packs/local_business_ai_visibility/lead_signal_weights.py`
  — pack `LEAD_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS` dict remains `{}` per §3 out-of-scope.
- `vertical_template`, `vertical_signal_definition`,
  `lead_event_definition`, all existing leads/lead_signals/
  lead_events/lead_score_snapshot tables — untouched.

## §6 Sub-phase breakdown

Seven commits after this plan doc (renumbered 2026-05-11 -- audit
during B.6A.4-completion surfaced that the codebase has no real-DB
test fixtures, so the originally-singular B.6A.5 split into B.6A.5
infra + B.6A.6 corpus). Each commit is independently revertable.
Smoke-test-first, verify-before-commit, stop between.

| Sub-phase | Scope | Smoke gate |
|---|---|---|
| **B.6A.0** | This plan doc | doc renders; references resolve |
| **B.6A.1** | Migration 0020 (seed only) + verification tests | alembic upgrade+downgrade clean; demo rows queryable + assertable; existing 600 backend tests + new verification tests all green |
| **B.6A.2** | `signal_results_to_observations` + unit tests | new tests pass; existing suite green |
| **B.6A.3** | Divergence comparator + `explain_divergence` (NO log emitter; deferred to B.6A.4) + unit tests | dataclass round-trip tests pass; existing suite green |
| **B.6A.4** | `analyze_and_persist` orchestrator + `log_divergence` emitter + mock-heavy tests | orchestrator round-trip mock-stages Lead + 4 LeadSignals + 1 LeadScoreSnapshot; all-or-nothing aborts on partial failure; existing suite green |
| **B.6A.5** | Real-DB test infrastructure (shared dev DB + nested-savepoint rollback) + CI Postgres service + self-tests | fixtures land; new `db_session`-using self-tests green locally; CI workflow yaml parses; existing mock-only suite passes untouched |
| **B.6A.6** | Corpus (10-15 inputs covering signal-score ranges + "Joe Pizza, Brooklyn, NY" baseline) + replay test against real DB | all corpus assertions pass within TOLERANCE=1; replay delta == 0 (exact, no tolerance); bridge-source grep matches corpus size |

Phase closure summary (no code commit) after B.6A.6: verification
pass, update memory with B.6A-complete + B.6B-pending status.

---

## §7 Divergence tooling spec (explainability-first scope)

Per Andrew's directive: "the highest-value outcome is not 'the bridge
exists' — it is 'we can confidently explain WHY the two systems agree
or disagree.'" This section drives B.6A.3 and is referenced by
B.6A.4 and B.6A.6.

### §7.1 What must be answerable

For any single `analyze_and_persist` call, after the fact, an
operator (or test failure output) must be able to answer:

1. What did each side compute? (legacy_score, canonical_score, delta)
2. Per signal, what was the legacy contribution? canonical contribution?
3. Per signal, did the weight differ? Did the score differ? Both?
4. What weight_version_at was used? What weights were active then?
5. Was the result within tolerance? (boolean — drives log severity)
6. If persisted: which Lead / snapshot rows back this?

All six are surfaced by `ScoreDivergence` + `SignalContributionDiff`.

### §7.2 Three consumers

- **Test failures:** `explain_divergence` renders multi-line diff
  that pytest dumps on assertion failure. Reading the test output
  alone tells the engineer which signal misbehaved.
- **Structured log:** `log_divergence` emits one event per call per
  ADR-030. Queryable across whatever volume the test corpus
  generates.
- **Future debug endpoint (deferred):** when read APIs land, a
  diagnostic endpoint can call `compute_divergence` against any
  stored snapshot + the legacy analyzer to re-explain after the
  fact. Not built in B.6A.

### §7.3 Tolerance semantics

- `BRIDGE_DIVERGENCE_TOLERANCE = 1` — accounts for int rounding
  vs Decimal quantize boundary cases.
- Mirror phase (B.6A) tolerance stays at 1.
- Convergence phase (B.6B) MAY tighten to 0 once legacy is retired
  and there is a single source of truth. Single-constant change.

---

## §8 Test surface

### §8.1 Unit tests

- `test_signal_adapter.py`: SignalResult → SignalObservation shape;
  boundary scores (0.0, 0.5, 1.0); reject score outside [0,1];
  source/provenance fields populated.
- `test_scoring_divergence.py`: comparator joins by signal_name;
  missing-on-either-side cases; tolerance boundary; log severity
  selection; explain_divergence formatting.

### §8.2 Integration tests

- `test_analyze_and_persist.py`:
  - happy path: writes 1 Lead + 4 LeadSignals + 1 LeadScoreSnapshot
    in one transaction; returns populated BridgeResult.
  - all-or-nothing: simulated catalog miss raises; no Lead, no
    LeadSignals, no snapshot left behind.
  - divergence populated: BridgeResult.divergence has all 4 signals
    in breakdown; delta within tolerance for the seed weights.

### §8.3 Corpus tests (B.6A.5)

- `test_bridge_corpus.py`:
  - baseline: `("Joe Pizza", "Brooklyn, NY")` — legacy `score == 60`
    preserved; canonical within tolerance.
  - 50 synthetic `(business_name, city)` inputs covering signal
    score ranges (varied deterministic-hash seeds); assert
    `|legacy_int - int(canonical)| <= TOLERANCE` for all.
  - replay: persist a snapshot, re-run `compute_lead_score` with
    stored `inputs` + `weight_version_at`, assert equality (delta=0,
    not just within tolerance — replay is exact).
  - partial-catalog fail: drop one weight row, call orchestrator,
    assert canonical excludes that signal AND legacy includes it AND
    divergence is logged at ERROR (fail-safe in the orchestrator;
    test asserts behavior).

### §8.4 Baseline preservation

The existing baseline `analyze('Joe Pizza','Brooklyn, NY').score == 60`
MUST remain green throughout all 7 sub-phases. The bridge is dark
code; it cannot affect this assertion.

### §8.5 Partial-catalog mutation test (deferred)

The plan §8.3 mentioned a "drop one weight row mid-test, call
orchestrator, assert canonical excludes that signal" test. Per
the audit decision 2026-05-11, this test is DEFERRED out of B.6A.6
scope. Rationale: it requires mid-test mutation of seeded data,
which adds DB-fixture complexity beyond the narrowest-safe corpus.
The unobserved-signal code path is already covered by unit tests
in `test_scoring_divergence.py::
test_unobserved_canonical_signal_shows_weight_but_zero_score`.
Reconsider in B.6B if real partial-catalog drift surfaces.

---

## §9 Open items deferred to B.6B

1. Retire `_blended_score`.
2. Refactor `analyze()` into a thin wrapper over
   `analyze_and_persist`.
3. Wire HTTP endpoint to canonical persistence path (feature flag,
   fail-safe).
4. Tighten `BRIDGE_DIVERGENCE_TOLERANCE` to 0 once legacy retired.
5. Decide whether `vertical_signal_weight` (legacy pack weights)
   table is deprecated, dropped, or repurposed.
6. Decide whether to populate the pack's `LEAD_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS` dict
   and converge sources (currently the seed migration is the sole
   source of truth).
7. Real-tenancy resolution (replace demo account).
8. Lead dedupe / upsert semantics.

Each item is one or more B.6B sub-phases. None are in B.6A scope.

---

## §10 Rollback story

B.6A is fully dark code with one seed migration and one CI yaml
change. Rollback paths per sub-phase:

- **B.6A.2 -> B.6A.4** (orchestrator + adapter + comparator): `git
  revert` removes the new files. No production path depends on
  them. Tests are additive. Migration is unaffected.
- **B.6A.5** (real-DB fixtures + CI Postgres service): `git revert`
  reverts the conftest additions, removes `test_db_fixtures.py`,
  reverts the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` modification (Postgres
  service block + DATABASE_URL env). No production-code change to
  revert; the next CI run after the revert returns to the pre-B.6A.5
  pytest job shape.
- **B.6A.6** (corpus + replay tests): `git revert` removes
  `test_bridge_corpus.py`. No production-code or fixture-shape
  change to revert.
- **Migration revert**: `alembic downgrade -1` drops the seed rows
  (0020 downgrade) -- demo account + demo vertical + 4 signal
  definitions + 4 lead weight rows. Existing vertical/account/lead
  rows are untouched (the demo account is the only account row
  this migration touches, and its UUID5 derivation makes its
  identity unambiguous).
- **Full phase revert**: revert B.6A.6 -> B.6A.5 -> B.6A.4 ->
  B.6A.3 -> B.6A.2 -> B.6A.1 code, then `alembic downgrade -1`.
  Repo returns to `1b303ab`-equivalent state (B.6A.0 plan doc
  still present, no schema/data/test-fixture change applied).

If B.6A.6 corpus tests reveal unfixable divergence: the bridge
stays as latent infrastructure; B.6B is blocked until the
divergence is understood. No prod path was touched, so nothing
breaks; only the convergence plan is paused.
